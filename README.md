# w4CSeq: software and web application to analyze 4C-Seq data

w4CSeq applies a customized pipeline to deal with both enzyme digestion and sonication fragmentation based 4C-Seq data. 
It identifies 4C sites, statistically significant regions, draws interacting plots for intra-chromosomal and inter-chromosomal interactions, and overlays genomic features (TSS, TTS, CpG sites), DNA replication timing and user-provided annotation onto it. 
The combined plots will help uncover significant features in/around 4C regions. 

# Features
* Web server with simple input specification and multiple outputs.
* Users can download the software and install their own servers in a local environment, or use command line to perform analysis.
* Able to analyze 4C-Seq data generated by both enzyme-digestion and sonication-fragmentation methods.

# Usage
## 1. Server
### *demo web server*
* We provide a demo server [w4CSeq](http://w4cseq.wglab.org/) for you to examine. 

### *build your own server*

##### a. Download and Install
Users can download the cutting edge version from GitHub by `git clone git@github.com:WGLab/w4CSeq.git`.

##### b. Software prerequisite
The following softwares should be installed in your cluster before you build server or run w4CSeq command line.
  * R (Packages: RCircos, quantsmooth)
  * Perl (Module: Math::CDF, List::Util)
  * BWA
  * SAMtools
  * BEDTools

##### c. Build `lib` directory
To build the required `lib` directory, users can download `lib.tar.gz` file from [here](http://w4cseq.wglab.org/W4CSEQ_files/lib.tar.gz).
Then extract files under `/w4cseq/` directory by `tar -zxvf lib.tar.gz -C /PATH/TO/w4cseq/`. After that, there will be four sub-directories (`bin`, `cgi-bin`, `html`, `lib`) under `/w4cseq/`, and four sub-sub-directories (`hg19`, `hg18`, `mm10`, and `mm9`) under `/w4cseq/lib/`. 

Each sub-directory (`hg19`, `hg18`, `mm10`, and `mm9`) under `/w4cseq/lib/` consists of genome sequence and index files (for BWA alignment); annotation files for TTSs, TSSs, CpG sites and genes; reduced library of genome-wide enzyme recognition sites; DNA replication timing annotation files; and cytoband definition file. 

##### d. Specify paths of softwares in program
  * ##### Enzyme-digestion based 4C-Seq 
    * In `4C_enzyme.R`under `/w4cseq/bin/`, 1) specify the following (`path_w4CSeq`, `path_bwa`, `path_samtools`, `path_bedtools`, `path_RCircos`, `path_quantsmooth`), representing your paths to `w4CSeq`, `BWA`, `SAMtools`, `BEDTools`, `RCircos` and `quantsmooth` respectively; 2) specify your interpreter in the very first `#!` line. 
    * In `Enzyme.cgi` under `/w4cseq/cgi-bin/` and `control_w4cseq_enzyme.pl` under `/w4cseq/bin/`, specify the following (`$CARETAKER`, `$SERVER_DIRECTORY`, `$WEBSITE`), representing `email` of housekeeper, path to `w4CSeq`, and assigned website address for your server respectively.

  * ##### Sonication-digestion based 4C-Seq 
    * In `4C_sonication.R`under `/w4cseq/bin/`, 1) specify the following (`path_w4CSeq`, `path_bwa`, `path_samtools`, `path_bedtools`, `path_RCircos`, `path_quantsmooth`); 2) specify your interpreter in the very first `#!` line.
    * In `Sonication.cgi` under `/w4cseq/cgi-bin/` and `control_w4cseq_sonication.pl` under `/w4cseq/bin/`, specify the following (`$CARETAKER`, `$SERVER_DIRECTORY`, `$WEBSITE`).

Once these are set up, the server is ready to go.


## 2. Command line
We recommend you build your own server since it will take input and yield output in an automated manner. Alternatively, you can use one-line command to analyze your 4C-Seq data.

##### a. Complete the `a`, `b`, and `c` steps in `1. Server` section.

##### b. We suggest you perform all analysis under `/w4cseq/work/` directory (if it doesn't exist, creat one by `mkdir /w4cseq/work`), and set separate subdirectory to store outputs for each analysis for clean organization.

#Output
w4CSeq provides multiple outputs for you. Please refer to [demo](http://w4cseq.usc.edu/done/827/vH_Y7YpVpXVak9Fk/index.html) result for enzyme-digestion based 4C-Seq result and [demo](http://w4cseq.usc.edu/done/829/2QlTqIO_4FVuKid-/index.html) result for sonication-fragmentation based 4C-Seq result.

If you use command line tool to analyze data, output files are stored in the sub-directory you specified. The descriptions for important files are listed below.

Tabular files:
  1. **DISTAL_INTERACTION_SITES.bed**: This file contains all the restriction sites that have interacting signals covered. The first three columns characterize the location of a covered restriction site and the fourth column is the number of reads mapped there.
  2. **DISTAL_INTERACTION_SITES_pValue.bed**: This file contains the restriction sites with the fourth column representing the p-values after modeling.
  3. **DISTAL_INTERACTION_SITES_pValue_adjusted.bed**: This file contains the restrction sites with the fourth column representing the p-values adjusted using BH/FDR method.
  4. **positive_hits.bed**: This file contains the interacting sites with adjusted p-value less than specified significance threshold (e.g. 0.05). 
  5. **SIGNIFICANT_REGIONS.bed**: This file contains significant regions where neighbouring significant sites are close. (Each site is extended into a window with size of size_inter (trans) or size_intra (cis). Those sites with overlapping windows are merged into domains and boundaries of domains are documented.)

Files for visualization in genome browsers:
  1. **MAPPED_BAM.bam**: File of mapped reads. Note that it contains PCR artifacts so caution need to be exercised. **MAPPED_BAM.bam.bai** is the index file required to be loaded together with the bam file.
  2. **UCSC_view.bed**: File characterizing raw reads pile-up. It can be examined in UCSC genome browser.
  3. **window.bed**: File characterizing the captured sites summed in smoothing window. It can be examined in UCSC genome browser.

  2. **circos.png\pdf**: Circos plot of genome‐wide distribution of 4C interactions as indicated by curves extended from the ‘bait’ region. Intra-chromosomal (cis) and inter-chromosomal (trans) interactions are shown in red and blue, respectively.
  3. **spider.png\pdf**: Spider plot depicting contacts centered on the ‘bait’ region.
