<h1>w4CSeq: software and web application to analyze 4C-Seq data.</h1>
<br>
w4CSeq applies a customized pipeline to deal with both enzyme digestion and sonication fragmentation based 4C-seq data. 
It identifies 4C sites, statistically significant regions, draws interacting plots for intra-chromosome and inter-chromosome interactions, 
and overlays genomic features (TSS, TTS, CpG sites), DNA replication timing and user-provided annotation onto it. 
The combined plot will help uncover significant features in/around 4C regions.
