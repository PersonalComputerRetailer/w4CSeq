# w4CSeq: software and web application to analyze 4C-Seq data.

w4CSeq applies a customized pipeline to deal with both enzyme digestion and sonication fragmentation based 4C-seq data. 
It identifies 4C sites, statistically significant regions, draws interacting plots for intra-chromosome and inter-chromosome interactions, and overlays genomic features (TSS, TTS, CpG sites), DNA replication timing and user-provided annotation onto it. 
The combined plots will help uncover significant features in/around 4C regions. 

## Features
* Easy to download and install: Users can download the software and install their own servers in a local environment, and then use command line to analyze raw 4C-Seq data.
* Able to analyze 4C-Seq data generated by both enzyme-digestion and sonication-fragmentation methods.
* Simple input specification and multiple outputs.


## Usage

*command line*
* After you download and install w4CSeq server
